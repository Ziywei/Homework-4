# Homework-4
hw4 for AMS 325
#There are two tasks for the fourth homework assignment, the first is to write a Python
#script file to compute the Mandelbrot fractal with some of the given iteration steps and the
#second is to write a Python script to perform six other sub-tasks. Throughout the assignment, I
#defined two functions, one for each task, using double for loops to proceed the iterations that
#generate the plots.
